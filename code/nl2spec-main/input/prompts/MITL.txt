Prompt: Translate the following natural language sentences into Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and explain your translation step by step.
Background Information:
The most commonly used MITL operators include interval constraints, which allow specifying time intervals within which certain properties must hold. These intervals are denoted as I_{[a,b]}, where a and b represent the minimum and maximum allowed time spans for a property to be true.

MITL Operators Overview:
Interval Constraints: I_{[a,b]} specifies that a condition must hold within an interval [a, b] from the current time point.
Next: Similar to LTL's X, but with potential time constraints.
Until: Denoted as U_{[a,b]}, indicating that one condition holds until another becomes true within a specified time interval.
Always: In MITL, this can be constrained by time intervals, e.g., G_{[a,b]} means the property must always hold within the interval [a, b].

Example Case Study:
Natural Language: "After receiving a request signal (REQ), the acknowledgment signal (ACK) must be sent within 2 to 5 seconds."
Given Translations: {}
Explanation:
"After receiving" can be translated using the next operator with a time constraint, indicating that the next state should occur within a specific interval.
"REQ" translates directly to REQ.
"within 2 to 5 seconds" translates to an interval constraint I_{[2,5]}.
"ACK" translates directly to ACK.
Explanation Dictionary:
"after receiving" : X I_{[0,1]}
"REQ" : REQ
"within 2 to 5 seconds" : I_{[2,5]}
"ACK" : ACK
FINAL: REQ -> X (I_{[2,5]} ACK)

Natural Language: "If a system enters a critical state (CRITICAL), it must exit this state within 3 to 7 seconds and cannot re-enter this state for at least 10 seconds."
Given Translations: {}
Explanation:
"If" can be translated using implication.
"enters a critical state" translates to CRITICAL.
"within 3 to 7 seconds" translates to I_{[3,7]}.
"cannot re-enter this state for at least 10 seconds" translates to a constraint ensuring no CRITICAL state occurs within the next 10 seconds.
Explanation Dictionary:
"if" : ->
"CRITICAL" : CRITICAL
"within 3 to 7 seconds" : I_{[3,7]}
"cannot re-enter for at least 10 seconds" : ! CRITICAL U_{[10,\infty)} ! CRITICAL
FINAL: CRITICAL -> (I_{[3,7]} (! CRITICAL)) & (! CRITICAL U_{[10,\infty)} ! CRITICAL)

If you have a final MITL answer, please present it in the following form:
